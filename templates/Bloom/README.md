# BLOOM

A powerful open-source multilingual language model with 176 billion parameters supporting 46 languages and 13 programming languages, developed specifically for academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, and smaller research labs.

## Description

BLOOM (BigScience Large Open-science Open-access Multilingual Language Model) is a decoder-only transformer language model developed by the BigScience workshop, a collaborative effort dedicated to democratizing access to large language model research. As a fully open-source alternative to proprietary commercial models, BLOOM is specifically designed to serve the needs of academia, nonprofits, and smaller research labs.

## Features

- Support for 46 natural languages and 13 programming languages
- Available in multiple sizes (176B, 7.1B, 3B, 1.7B, 560M parameters)
- Optimized for distributed inferencing across Nosana nodes
- RESTful API for text generation and embeddings
- Containerized deployment with horizontal scaling

## Usage

The model is served through a RESTful API with endpoints for text generation and embeddings. Configuration settings allow for parameter adjustment and resource allocation based on deployment needs.

  - Tokenizer vocabulary: 250,680 tokens
  - Trained on text from 46 natural languages
  - Includes 13 programming languages
- **Training Infrastructure**:
  - Trained on 384 A100 GPUs (80GB memory each)
  - One copy of the model required 48 GPUs (using 60GB memory per GPU)
  - Training throughput: ~150 TFLOPs
  - Training duration: 3-4 months (started March 11, 2022)
  - Trained on the Jean Zay public supercomputer
- **Capabilities**:

## Environmental Considerations

- Jean Zay supercomputer is primarily powered by nuclear energy, a low carbon energy source
- Computing infrastructure designed for high efficiency, with waste heat repurposed for heating buildings on campus
- Detailed carbon emissions estimates for training and inference are being developed

## License

This model is released under the RAIL (Responsible AI License), an open license allowing commercial use with ethical restrictions.
