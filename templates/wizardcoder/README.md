#### Demo with python request
```python
import requests

payload= {
    "model": "wizardcoder",
    "prompt": "Write a Python script to scrape all H1 tags from a webpage using BeautifulSoup",
    "stream": False
}
response=requests.post(
    url="http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/generate",
    json=payload,
)
print(response.json()["response"])

```

#### Response
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = 'https://example.com' # Replace with the desired URL
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
h1_tags = soup.find_all('h1')
for h1 in h1_tags:
    print(h1.text) # or do whatever you want to do with the H1 tag content here
```
```text
Here, we first make a GET request to the desired URL using `requests` and then pass the response HTML content to BeautifulSoup's constructor. We then use the `find_all()` method of BeautifulSoup to find all the H1 tags in the page. Finally, we iterate over each tag and print its text or do whatever else you want to do with it.
```
