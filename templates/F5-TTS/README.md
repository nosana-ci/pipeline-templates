# F5-TTS

High-quality text-to-speech synthesis using flow matching technology.

## Overview
F5-TTS (Fairytaler that Fakes Fluent and Faithful Speech) is an advanced text-to-speech model that generates highly natural and expressive speech. It leverages flow matching techniques to create voice outputs with improved prosody, natural intonation, and emotional expression.

## Features
- Exceptionally natural-sounding speech synthesis
- Better handling of long-form text and prosody
- Support for multiple voices and speaking styles
- Improved emotional expressiveness compared to traditional TTS models
- Fast inference speeds for efficient deployment

## Technical Details
- Based on the flow matching framework for generative modeling
- Trained on the Emilia dataset for high-quality voice synthesis
- Implements a novel architecture focused on speech naturalness
- Research model featured in the paper "F5-TTS: A Fairytaler that Fakes Fluent and Faithful Speech with Flow Matching"

## Requirements
- GPU: 8GB+ VRAM recommended
- Web interface on port 7860
- PyTorch environment with CUDA support
