## Description

Folding@home is the world's largest distributed computing platform for disease research, simulating protein dynamics to unlock medical breakthroughs. This Nosana job template enables organizations and individuals to sponsor computational research that accelerates scientific discovery.

By deploying this template on Nosana Network, you're funding critical computational work that helps scientists:

- **Disease Research**: Study protein misfolding in neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's)
- **Pandemic Response**: Accelerate COVID-19 and infectious disease research
- **Cancer Treatments**: Simulate protein interactions for oncology breakthroughs
- **Therapeutic Development**: Enable new approaches for drug discovery

Each completed job delivers verified scientific results to the Folding@home Consortium, a collaborative network of research labs and institutions worldwide. 

## How It Works

The workflow is simple but powerful:

1. **Job Initialization**: Deploy the template on the Nosana Network and an idle gpu connects to Folding@home servers
2. **Work Assignment**: Receives computational biology work units
3. **Processing**: Runs molecular dynamics simulations
4. **Results Delivery**: Automatically sends completed work back to researchers

## Technical information

- **GPU Requirements**: Modern GPU required (higher-end hardware processes work units faster)
- **Work Units**: Typically 1-5 hours of computation per unit depending on GPU model
- **Network Connection**: Stable internet required 



## Impact Metrics

- Processes billions of calculations per job
- Contributes to [peer-reviewed publications](https://foldingathome.org/papers-results/)
- Part of [NosanaNetwork team #1066496 statistics](https://stats.foldingathome.org/team/1066496)
