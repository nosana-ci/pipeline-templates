# Clojure Template

This is a Clojure project template.

The template is based on the [Clojure Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/clojure/).

You can define your ENV variables in the `global` property of the template.yml file.

The basic commands required to install, build, and test your project are listed in the `commands` property. 
We also show how to install and use `clj-kondo` in this template.
