# NPM Template

This is a template for Node.JS projects.

The template is based on the [Node.JS Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/).

You can define your ENV variables in the `global` property of the template.yml file.

The basic commands required to install, build, and test your project are listed in the `commands` property.

This template assumes you are using `npm` and that the run commands defined in the pipeline are defined in your `package.json` file.
