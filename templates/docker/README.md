# Docker Template

This is a Docker project template.

The template is based on the [Nosana Podman Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/nosana/podman)

You can define your ENV variables in the `global` property of the template.yml file.

The basic commands required to install, build, and test your project are listed in the `commands` property.
